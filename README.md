# Node.js and EJS Web Application Skeleton

Welcome to the Node.js and EJS Web Application Skeleton! This repository provides a basic template to help you get started with building web applications using Node.js and the EJS templating engine.

## Features

- Basic project structure for a Node.js web application.
- EJS templating engine preconfigured for dynamic HTML rendering.
- Sample routes and views to help you kickstart your development.
- Easy to understand and extend for various web application needs.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and start building your web application:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Purvapatel4725/Node-Webapp-Skeleton.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Node-Webapp-Skeleton
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, install the required npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:3000`. You can access it in your browser to see the default application page.

## Using Nodemon for Development

`nodemon` is a tool that helps automatically restart your server whenever you make changes to your code. This can speed up your development process by eliminating the need to manually restart the server.

### Installation

If you haven't installed `nodemon` globally, you can do so with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

- **`/public`**: Contains static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **`/views`**: Contains EJS template files for rendering HTML pages.
- **`/routes`**: Contains route handlers for your application.
- **`app.js`**: Main application file where the server is configured and routes are set up.
- **`package.json`**: Manages project dependencies and scripts.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this skeleton template to fit your project needs. You can:

- Add new routes in the `/routes` directory.
- Create new EJS templates in the `/views` directory.
- Modify styles and scripts in the `/public` directory.
